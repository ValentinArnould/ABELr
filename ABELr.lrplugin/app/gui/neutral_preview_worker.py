"""Neutral anchor renders ("Neutral Preview") — Qt worker + reusable function.

Renders each photo in its **current style** (DCP profile + tone + Color Grading)
but with **As Shot WB**, **Exposure2012=0** and **all 24 HSL sliders at zero**,
then measures this neutral render (GPU, dual global+sharp) and caches it in
`NeutralPreviewJPEG`. HSL is neutralized so the anchor stays independent of
HSL corrections applied afterward (otherwise every HSL Apply would invalidate
`hash_style` → a full re-probe on every cycle).

Purpose: deterministic anchor for embedded mode — the delta between in-camera
JPEG and neutral render yields **absolute** (idempotent) settings, independent
of the current render.

Mechanism: plugin job `render_probe` (`Thumbnails.fetchProbe`: apply → render →
**restore**), submitted **in batches** (`chunk_size`) to keep the bridge
heartbeat alive and bound the window during which photos sit in a neutral
state. Freshness key: `hash_style` (see `cache.style_hash`) — recomputed only
when the style changes, not when Temp/Exposure/HSL move.

Stale-probe guard: if a photo has a current `Exposure2012` marked as non-zero
(>= 0.3) but its "neutral" anchor measures the same lightness as its last
known rendered preview, the probe likely served a cached preview (not a fresh
render) → single retry with a long settle, then **explicit failure** (a
suspect anchor is NEVER cached — it would poison every calculation until the
style changes).

The probe re-reads Temperature/Tint AFTER applying `WhiteBalance='As Shot'`:
that is the numeric As Shot value (cached as `wb_asshot_temp/tint`), the basis
for an absolute WB correction. This read effectively verifies the assumption
"applyDevelopSettings{WhiteBalance='As Shot'} resets Temp/Tint".
